Digit Recognition for Visually Impaired People
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an accessible web-based application for digit recognition, specifically designed to assist visually impaired individuals. The core idea is to utilize a live camera feed to capture images of digits and then use machine learning to identify them, providing audio feedback to the user.

This repository currently hosts a foundational web application that demonstrates the camera access, user interface, and crucial audio feedback mechanism. While the digit recognition itself is simulated in this initial version, it lays the groundwork for integrating a robust Machine Learning model.

Features
Live Camera Feed: Accesses the user's webcam to display a real-time video stream.

Simulated Digit Recognition: A "Recognize Digit" button triggers a simulated recognition process, displaying a random digit from 0-9.

Audio Feedback: The recognized digit is announced verbally using the Web Speech API, making the application usable for visually impaired users without relying on visual cues.

Clear Visual Display: The recognized digit is displayed prominently in a large, high-contrast font for users with some residual vision.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be adaptable across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

How It Works (Current Version)
The current application functions as a proof-of-concept for the user interface and core accessibility features:

Camera Initialization: Upon loading, the application requests access to the user's webcam and displays the live video stream.

User Interaction: When the "Recognize Digit" button is clicked, a JavaScript function is triggered.

Simulated Recognition: For demonstration purposes, this function currently generates a random digit (0-9).

Display and Announce: The generated digit is then displayed on the screen, and simultaneously, the browser's text-to-speech capability pronounces the digit aloud, informing the user of the "recognized" number.

Getting Started
To run this demonstration:

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

(Note: Replace <repository-url> and <repository-name> with the actual details once hosted.)

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You do not need a web server for this basic setup.

Grant Camera Permissions: Your browser will likely prompt you to allow camera access. Please grant permission for the application to function.

Interact: Once the camera feed is visible, click the "Recognize Digit" button to see and hear the simulated recognition.

Future Enhancements
The primary goal for future development is to integrate a real machine learning model for accurate digit recognition. Planned enhancements include:

Machine Learning Integration:

Implementing a TensorFlow.js model (e.g., pre-trained on MNIST dataset) to perform actual digit recognition from the video feed.

Pre-processing of video frames (converting to grayscale, resizing, normalization) to prepare them for model input.

Improved User Experience:

Voice commands for triggering recognition.

Customizable voice and speaking rate options for audio feedback.

More robust error handling and user guidance.

Feedback Mechanism: Providing real-time visual feedback (e.g., bounding boxes around detected digits) for users with residual vision, while maintaining audio-first interaction.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring broad compatibility across different web browsers.
